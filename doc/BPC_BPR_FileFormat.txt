BPR and BPC file formats

In general, we represent breakpoints as a coordinate given by a pair of chrom/pos (Breakpoint Coordinates, or BPC).
Alternatively, we may consider a breakpoint region (BPR), which has a pair of chrom/pos.start/pos.end values.
Breakpoints with precise positions (e.g., discordant pair positions) will be represented by the former,
while regions such as SV Events will be represented by the latter.

Each breakpoint coordinate or region is represented just once, with chromA < chromB, or posA < posB if chromA==chromB
     Both are represented in a TSV file,
       BPC: chromA, posA, chromB, posB, [attribute]
       BPR: chromA, posA.start, posA.end, chromB, posB.start, posB.end, [attribute]
     Both datatypes have optional attribute column

BPC and BPR files have no headers.  Lines starting with # are ignored.

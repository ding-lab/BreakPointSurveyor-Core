In some cases a contig may have more than one breakpoint, and we can draw a line 
between breakpoints co-occurring on a contig to illustrate this relationship.
This functionality is not fully implemented, but can be based on processing of the
qSBP file.  Below are notes to guide future implementation.


Contig drawing based on work here:

```
/Users/mwyczalk/Data/Virus/Virus_2013.9a/CombinedPlot/BreakpointSurveyor/E_Discordant/2_test_crunch_discordant.sh
/Users/mwyczalk/Data/Virus/Virus_2013.9a/CombinedPlot/BreakpointSurveyor/E_Discordant/src/DiscordantCruncher.R
```

in particular, see function `render.annotation`, which draws SBP breakpoints and contigs based on rSBP and
qSBP, resp.

Below is a sample line from qSBP file for BA-4077.  Note that it only includes endpoints of the contig, not
the breakpoint itself, so that only one straight line is drawn.  Instead, we want a straight line from contig start
to breakpoint, then from breakpoint to contig end.  As such, qSBP will need to be reworked.
